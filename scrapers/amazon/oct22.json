{"text": "\n  I expected to like this book.  Having decided to read previously unread classics during the pandemic, I have enjoyed Wuthering Heights and A Separate Peace, and adored A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Having gone 3-for-3, I felt sure Heart of Darkness would be a perfect 4-for-4.  Alas, it was not.  This is a hard book to read and enjoy.  Had it not been short,  I am not sure I could have forced myself to finish.  The dense, meandering prose was a challenge, as was the narrator\u2019s constant changing of the narration without warning from the story itself, to addressing the men to whom he was telling the story, to long internal musings and introspection.  There is little plot, little character development, and (I think) only two characters in the story were given a real name.  If I have to read about dark and  difficult subjects such as imperialism, brutality, racism, greed, madness, etc., I prefer it with an interesting plot and at a pace faster than molasses.\n"},
