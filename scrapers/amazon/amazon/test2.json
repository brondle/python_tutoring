{"text": "\n  This is my review #200. Since it is a landmark of sorts, I decided to write about a book that marked a turning point in my development as a reader, just as I chose to write my review #100 on _The Catcher in the Rye_, almost two years ago. The main problem the reviewer faces when writing about classics is that most of what can be said about them--and unfortunately much more--appears to have been said already. The most obvious way out of the problem is to make the review a personal reflection, a kind of memoir-review, if you will, and that will be my approach here. What is important to me about Joseph Conrad\u2019s _Hear of Darkness_? Hopefully, my response will include something that resonates with you."},
{"text": "\n  I expected to like this book.  Having decided to read previously unread classics during the pandemic, I have enjoyed Wuthering Heights and A Separate Peace, and adored A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Having gone 3-for-3, I felt sure Heart of Darkness would be a perfect 4-for-4.  Alas, it was not.  This is a hard book to read and enjoy.  Had it not been short,  I am not sure I could have forced myself to finish.  The dense, meandering prose was a challenge, as was the narrator\u2019s constant changing of the narration without warning from the story itself, to addressing the men to whom he was telling the story, to long internal musings and introspection.  There is little plot, little character development, and (I think) only two characters in the story were given a real name.  If I have to read about dark and  difficult subjects such as imperialism, brutality, racism, greed, madness, etc., I prefer it with an interesting plot and at a pace faster than molasses.\n"},
{"text": "\n  Reading Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad is a lot like running a 5K (3.2 miles) race. You start out slow and steady trying to get your pace and make your way through the convoluted mess of other racers, but by mile two you\u2019re huffing and puffing and ready to quit because it\u2019s a lot harder than you thought it would be. By the time you hit mile three you think you can\u2019t possibly keep going until finally the endorphins kick in and you realize, hey, you\u2019re actually having fun! Then before you know it the race is over, and you\u2019re left with a sense of wonder and accomplishment at having run the whole thing. Most importantly you take away a new identity of yourself; you, my friend, are now a Runner."},
{"text": "\n  There's so much going on in this short novel / story. The horror of European pillaging in Africa. The petty concerns of selfish functionaries whose only talent, only virtue, only superpower is to stay physically healthy in a place that routinely kills other Europeans through indigenous people's attacks, through disease, and through technology break downs."},
{"text": "\n  Intentionally written by the author to make it hard to read to make the reader feel like they were fighting through a jungle, just like Marlowe in the novella fought through in search of Kurtz, \"Heart of Darkness\" strikes straight into the heart of the art of writing where every word, phrase and sentence is deep and resounding."},
{"text": "\n  Oh, it is just so much more enjoyable to read books that were written back in the day.  Compared to reading the propaganda, garbage, and distortions churned out by modern day re-writers of history and self-proclaimed experts.  I call them virgins who've read the Kama Sutra.  They can tell you a hundred different positions, but they've never actually done it!  But here is an amazing little book, written in 1899, before the virus of political correctness, dealing with a very shameful period of history, that to this day has never been fully acknowledged, apologised for, or compensated for.  The Belgians were never colonisers in the true sense of the word.  Leopold II stole the Congo, in full site of the other colonial mavericks, as a personal possession, driven drunk by power, greed, and pure evil.  To this day, his descendants lack either the integrity or the intelligence to do the right thing.  THEY are the perpetuation of the Heart of Darkness.  A casual reader is unlikely to get much out of this book.  To appreciate Heart of Darkness, you need to have some knowledge of the backstory.  Two quick reads to get you up to speed are King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild, and Blood River by Tim Butcher.  With those books under your belt, Heart of Darkness will make much more sense to you.  Then, please join me in my crusade to demand that Leopold's descendants, who have and still live off his murderous plunderings, give all the money back to the Congo, along with consequential reparations.  They will protest their innocence.  People like that always do.  They will claim they've done nothing wrong.  Ditto.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Blood money never changes its colour.  Give it back!\n"},
{"text": "\n  This book was written a hundred years ago, so you will have to read 10 or 15 pages to get into the style and rhythm of his writing, but after that you can take off the training wheels and go pretty well on your own.  It's a good story about a guy that navigates a boat up the Congo river to relieve this crazy, brilliant guy named Kurtz who has been out in the bush way too long.  If you think the story may not be relevant, consider the movie \"Apocolypse Now\" with Marlon Brando as Kurtz.  Where do you think the line \"the horror, the horror\" came from?  That's right, this book, 100 years ago.  It's about a journey up the Congo into a strange no man's land, but it's also about the journey of life, sometimes exciting, sometimes crazy, often dark and mysterious.  Back then, Europeans used to plunder deep into Africa to harvest ivory.  Sound familiar?  This book is always on the top 100 books of all time and it's too bad to make it assigned reading because you should read a book like this when you can take it slow, bite by bite, when you want to----not because you have to.  Overall I liked it, and I'm glad I read it but even Conrad never thought it was all that great back when it was published, and the public hardly noticed when it came out.  Still, it's got something to say.  It's a short book and if you can get past the training wheels you'll finish it off within 3 or 4 sittings and by then, you'll want to go back and capture whatever you missed along the river...\n"},
{"text": "\n  As I read this story I kept thinking of Apocalypse Now which is based on this book.  That is both a blessing and a curse.  The movie provided some outline of the story, and I admire how well Coppola tracked this book from the Congo to Vietnam.  However, the two part at points and the book is more complete.  It is not an easy read.  First, the author changes scenes rather subtly.  He provides some lurid description while the action is going on in one place and suddenly the drama has moved onto another location.  Secondly, the author is dealing with a deep, dark, troubling and unfamiliar part of our nature.  I suspect one cannot fully understand the internal conflicts that separate the civil from the savage unless one has a tremendous empathy or suffered through some of horror himself.  Btw way of these observations is this advice: read carefully. Slowly.  Back and forth, to be sure you are stitching together the plot elements and at least probing the psychological depths.\n"}
